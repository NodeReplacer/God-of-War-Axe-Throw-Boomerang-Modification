# Boomerang
 Exploring 3Cs of character by copying the God of War axe throw but using a boomerang instead. Initially wanted to copy the Wind Boomerang from Twilight Princess but it seems to just make a straight path and then starts clipping through objects for multiple targets. This influences the trajectory of the object itself.
